Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).

- AWS started in 2006 in earlt stages of cloud computing develeopment .
-  It owns 70% of the cloud services stake.

## Benefits 

- Agility
-  Elasticity
- Cost savings 
- Deploy globally in minutes

## Types

#### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. 
- It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. 
- IaaS gives you the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources. 
- It is most similar to the existing IT resources with which many IT departments and developers are familiar. 

#### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

> PaaS removes the need for you to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems), and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. 

- This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application. 

#### Software as a Service (SaaS)

> SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to SaaS are referring to end-user applications (such as web-based email). 

- With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. 
- You only need to think about how you will use that particular software.

- It's one of the resource service offering by AWS 
> Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. 

- Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. 
- You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage.
- Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.
